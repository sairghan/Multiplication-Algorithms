# Multiplication-Algorithms

This is one of the projects of my Algorithm Design (INFSCI 2591) course at School of Information Sciences (iSchool), University of Pittsburgh. 

The objective is to design two programs, one for the Ala Carte Multiplication algorithm and one for the Rectangle Multiplication algorithm. 

Both programs allow positive and negative multiplicands and multipliers.

Any questions regarding the source code, idea, implementation etc. can be routed to me.
